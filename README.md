## 🛠️ Featured Projects



### Active Directory Homelab

Active Directory home lab that includes Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team to simulate a realistic domain environment.  
I ingest Windows and AD logs into Splunk, run Atomic Red Team test cases, and generate attack telemetry to learn how common threats appear in a SIEM and how to detect them.

### Cloud SOC Lab (Azure)

Azure-based home SOC lab with a vulnerable honeypot VM to attract real attackers and real-world telemetry.  
I configure Sysmon for detailed host monitoring, forward logs to Microsoft Sentinel, build KQL queries for failed logins and attack patterns, use a Geo‑IP watchlist for threat mapping, and visualize attacker activity with custom workbooks.
